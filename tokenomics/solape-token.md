# ðŸª™ SOLAPE Token

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Group 548.png>)

Solape initially minted a total of 1 billion SOLAPE â€“ 250 million of which were airdropped to \~2,000 users that filled in a Google Form. The project later burned 701.5 million SOLAPE (or roughly 70% of the supply).

The team currently holds an estimated 8.7% of the supply (\~25 million tokens) and weâ€™re proud to say that the remaining supply is distributed in over 9,000 accounts.\

The SOLAPE token exists to bring value to our users. So far, holders have earned over $20k in airdrops from our various ecosystem peers. Check out the full list of these events [here](https://solapeswap.io/#/past-airdrops).\
