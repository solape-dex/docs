![](<../.gitbook/assets/sticker42144 (1).png>)

_A fool and his money are soon parted._ \
The Internet has made it easier than ever for even the most smooth-brained scammers to trick users into handing over access to their email, bank accounts, and crypto holdings.

Cryptocurrency is very attractive to malicious actors for a number of reasons: \
â€¢ **Once a transaction is done, itâ€™s done**. You canâ€™t call the â€˜Solana bankâ€™ and ask them to undo the                                                          transfer you just made to a scammer. \
â€¢ **Itâ€™s easily made anonymous**. With freely available tools and techniques, scammers can obscure the trail left on the blockchain. \
â€¢ **Itâ€™s liquid**. Within minutes of stealing your funds, bad actors can sell them for cash or use them to buy goods and services. \
â€¢ **Itâ€™s global**. Scammers donâ€™t need to even be on the same continent as you.

Long story short: there are a lot of incentives for malicious actors to come up with creative methods to part you with your money. So hereâ€™s Solapeâ€™s idiot-proof guide for staying safe in the Wild West of crypto.



### Nobody honest wants your seed phrase&#x20;

**We will never ask you to give us your seed phrase and neither will ANY reputable service**. There is literally zero reason for us to know it. A seed phrase wonâ€™t (and canâ€™t) help us troubleshoot issues you might have.

The only person that should know it is you. Write it down on a piece of paper and hide it, because anyone with knowledge of it can spend all your funds. Yep, that means the guy messaging you on Discord telling you he can double your money, too.



### We will never message you first&#x20;

We love all our users, but weâ€™re too busy to message you all individually with great offers or to ask you to download shady software updates. If you get a message from someone claiming to be from the Solape team asking you to take action, report it to us via discord, email, or twitter.\

### Learn the URL&#x20;

[solape.io](https://www.solape.io/) and [solapeswap.io](https://solapeswap.io/) point to our official websites.

Not _sollape.io_, nor _solape.com_, not even _legitsolapeexchange2022.com_.

Ideally, you should bookmark one of our two URLs to avoid clicking on a fraudulent one. If youâ€™re accessing the website any other way, make sure you double-check that youâ€™ve got it right. We have no control over any impersonating websites and canâ€™t help if things go wrong.
