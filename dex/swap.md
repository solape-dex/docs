Step 5:  Enter the amount you would like to swap.\
In this example we are swapping 100 USDC into DUST tokens.\
As the trader already has existing token accounts for both USDC and DUST, they do not need to follow the 'Setup' button. \
\
_Note: If you are trading a new token pair that you do not have an account for, you may need to follow the 'Setup' button to create the initial token account for trading. This costs approximately 0.02 SOL, covers blockchain rent fees and is reclaimable when you no longer wish to use the account._
