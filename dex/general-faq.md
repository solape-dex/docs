### What do I need to trade on Solape DEX?

Getting started with Solape is easy. All you need is the following:

* Some SOL, Solana‚Äôs native cryptocurrency&#x20;
* A Solana wallet

Solape DEX does not support cash-to-crypto trades, so we recommend using an exchange like FTX or Binance to get your SOL. Usually, an exchange will ask you to sign up, verify your identity and fund the account with your method of choice (bank transfer, debit/credit card, etc.).

Once this is done, you can buy your SOL with ease. This cryptocurrency is the fuel of the Solana ecosystem: for every transaction you make, you pay a miniscule amount of SOL to reward the validators for processing it.

When you‚Äôve got your SOL, you need a **Solana wallet**. While your funds are on the exchange, you can‚Äôt use them with Solape or other decentralized applications. You need to control your own private keys, which you can do with the following wallets:

* [**Phantom Wallet**](https://phantom.app/) **(recommended)**
* [**Solflare**](https://solflare.com/)
* [**MathWallet**](https://mathwallet.org/)
* [**Sollet**](http://sollet.io)
* [**A Ledger hardware wallet**](https://www.ledger.com/) **(most secure)**

Once you‚Äôve set this up (make sure to **write down your seed phrase** **and** **not to share it with anyone**), you‚Äôll see a SOL address. Transfer your funds from the exchange to this address. You‚Äôre then ready to interact with Solape by tapping Connect on the top-right corner of [**the app**](https://solapeswap.io/#/market/6RSZYm1jPB5BdBgBvDhmRB1TYNsLTkTvAMH6yQr128ac)!

### What is Solape and what makes it different?

Solape is the Solana‚Äôs ecosystem‚Äôs favorite decentralized exchange, built for apes, by apes.

* We airdropped and burned over 70% of the SOLAPE supply **‚Äì giving away over $1.6M to anyone who filled out a Google Form**
* **We‚Äôre degens, too**

### **Why build on Solana?**

To us at Solape, like so many developers, building on Solana was an easy choice.

We believe that the future of finance is cheap and fast. We want to see a world where anyone can interact with a global network of decentralized applications and we believe that Solana‚Äôs unique architecture is the perfect foundation for this new generation of finance.

Capable of tens of thousands of transactions per second, 400ms block times, and transactions costing no more than $0.01, Solana is how blockchains should be done.
